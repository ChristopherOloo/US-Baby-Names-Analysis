    "## Why do a Baby Names analysis project?\n",
    "### a. To the parent(s) plus.\n",
    "Humans have always been primarily known by their names. Among the family mambers, friends, schools, work places and religious gatherings; names play a vital role in our identity. There are those who are generally fullfiled, satisfied and happy with their names; on the other hand too, there are those who feel ashamed or may secretely want to hide or be called a particular name(s) given by his/her parents. There are also relgious belief or even physchological ones that names given to babies at birth may one way or the other shape their lives based on character, achievements among others. **There are also names which usually become too common among a particular age group or even in a generation. There are those who prefer unique names rather than common names. Knowing the popularity of a name to name a baby at birth or over the previous decade may be of hepl to avoid such common names.** Because of these among others, it's importants for parents or to be fully knowlegeable of names, the wide range of choice and be able to choose only those they are happy and responsible about and believe that their son(s) or daughter(s) will be happy and proud of when called in their lifetimes. The project also aim at helping parents to concentrate on the particular names or issues of names they may be interested about and eliminate confusion that might be encountered because of vast names available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. To the business data driven applications like recommendation engines in an e-commerce site among others.\n",
    "In many eco-commerce sites, customers usually sign up using First Name, Last Name and Email address. Baby Names analytics to know the possible religion or origin or a name can in some aspect perhaps help in creation of a recommendation engine to reccomend other religous or native products even without history. **To research about this.**"
